# Cypherpulse PGP 

I will now implement the full vision described in your initial request, transforming CypherPulse from a standalone PGP explorer into a comprehensive Cypher-Writer Studio.
This update 

## integrates:Writer's

Studio (CMS): A high-performance markdown editor with a "Focus Mode" and auto-save indicators.
AI Writing Assistant: Integrated directly into the editor to refine tone, check grammar, and suggest content.
Kanban Workflow: A task management board to track project progress from "Manuscript" to "Published".
Community Feed: A creative space to see trending encrypted or public works.
PGP Security Layer: The previous PGP Analyzer and Decoder are now located in the "Identity & Security" module for signing works.


## Specifications

Visual Design: Maintaining the "Stealth Cryptography" aesthetic—deep blacks (#050505), matrix greens, and glassmorphic panels.
Studio Behavior: Features a real-time word counter and an AI "Refine" button that uses Gemini to polish prose.
Workflow: A responsive Kanban board with column-based status tracking.
Identity Integration: Users can "Verify" their writing identity by switching to the PGP Analyzer.
